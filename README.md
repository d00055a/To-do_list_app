# To-Do List App

A simple and interactive *To-Do List Web App* built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
This project allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with data persistence using *localStorage*.


Objectives:
- Use HTML and CSS for layout and design.
- Implement JavaScript for adding, updating and deleting tasks.
- Store tasks in the browser’s local storage to persist data.


Features:
- Add new tasks  
- Delete tasks  
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete  
- Save tasks in the browser's *localStorage* (tasks remain even after page reload)  
- Modal box alert if the user tries to add an empty task  
- Tasks are displayed in a two-column alternating layout (left/right)  


Technologies used:
- HTML5 --> Structure of the page  
- CSS3 --> Styling, layout, and animations  
- JavaScript (ES6) --> Functionality, interactivity, event handling  
- localStorage --> Persistent storage of tasks in the browser  


How it works:
1. Type a task in the input field.  
2. Click **Add** to insert the task.  
3. Tasks alternate left and right in the list.  
4. Click on a task to mark it as completed.  
5. Press the **X** button at the right of each task to remove it.  
6. Click the **Clear All** button to remove all tasks.
