# To-Do List App

A simple and interactive **To-Do List web application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to practice core frontend fundamentals and client-side data persistence.

The application allows users to create, manage, and track tasks, with data stored locally in the browser using **localStorage**.

## Features

- Add new tasks

- Delete tasks

- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete

- Persistent task storage using **localStorage**

- Modal alert when attempting to add an empty task

- Two-column alternating task layout (left/right)

- Responsive and animated UI


## Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Page structure

- **CSS3** – Styling, layout and animations

- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Application logic, event handling

- **localStorage** – Client-side data persistence

2. Click **Add** to insert the task

3. Tasks are displayed in an alternating left/right layout
